A data store is a repository for storing and managing data. While this workshop
covers exclusively digital data stores, for most of human history, data stores
were analog. Even today, we still use analog data stores like libraries,
museums, and filing cabinets. Data stores have two primary functions. First,
they need to facilitate people accessing data (reading) and making changes to
the data (writing). Second, they need to preserve this access over a period of
time.

It is important to remember that not all data stores, even digital ones, are
databases. A pile of papers on a desk is definitely not a database, but it
could be considered a data store, albeit a bad one. Probably the most commonly
used type of data store is a flat file, a stand alone file on your computer
that is not linked to data elsewhere. Sometimes these files have specific
software that is designed to interact with them, like in the case of .xlsx
files and Microsoft Excel. However, a flat file can also be as simple as a text
file, like a .csv or .json.

Compared to flat files, databases increase the level of complexity the data is
capable of capturing. A database is an organized collection of data that users
can interact with through specialized software called a database management
system, often abbreviated DBMS. Databases have several key characteristics that
differentiate them from other data stores.

Should I include something about speed?
Should I discuss lack of GUI

```
1.  **Structure** - Databases store data with much more complicated structures
    than other stores can handle.

2.  **Scalability** - Any database software will store much more data than
    other digital data stores from day one. Additionally, databases do not have
    preset size limitations. Adding more computing resources to the machine
    running your database will increase its capabilities.

3.  **Access** - Databases support concurrent access and have sophisticated
    methods for managing simultaneous transactions. They also provide
    fine-grained controls on who can access, modify, and delete data.

Specific types of databases have other differentiating features, like data
integrity constraints, flexible data structure support, and a lack of a
graphical user interface.

```{css, echo=FALSE}
pre {
  max-height: 300px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

pre[class] {
  max-height: 300px;
}
```

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.scroll-300 {
  max-height: 300px;
  overflow-y: auto;
  background-color: inherit;
}
```

## Spreadsheets


<!--
why not excel:
Excel file is proprietary (owned by a company)
also can have csv file, aka ASCII delimited file (not sure I will go into this)

Spreadsheets, a type of flat file, are the most ubiquitous form of (digital)
data store. If you have used Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you have used a
a spreadsheet. In fact spreadsheet applications transformed the use of the
personal computer, particularly in business circles. Despite this, a
spreadsheet is not a database. Like most modern applications, spreadsheet
software have graphical user interfaces, making the barrier to entry very low.
Spreadsheet applications also offer some built in analysis tools, so you don't
have to learn a new application to do basic statistics and data visualization.

Spreadsheet software also suffers from some drawbacks. They offer limited
storage capacity, making it difficult to work with large data sets. Excel and
LibreOffice have a maximum row number of a little over 1 million and Google
Sheets limits you to 10 million cells. Software operations will also slow down
if you get close to their data capacity. This means analyzing large data sets
is much more tedious analyzing small ones.

Spreadsheets also store data in ways that cause a lot of data duplication and
make data entry susceptible to typos. In the spreadsheet visualized below, we
have data on the Die Hard franchise. Specifically, we have information about
the actors that starred in the series and the movies in which they appeared.

```{r, class.output="scroll-300", echo=FALSE}
library(data.table)

dh = fread('data/die_hard.csv', header=FALSE)
setnames(dh, names(dh),
         c('title_id', 'person_id', 'primary_title', 'premiered', 
           'runtime_minutes', 'genres', 'rating', 'votes', 'name', 'birth',
            'death', 'role', 'characters'))

dh

```

As you can see, there is a lot of data duplication, meaning our data set takes
up much more space on our hard drive than it needs to. Additionally, if we had
to change the information about a single movie or actor, we would have to make
that change in many different places, and potentially miss one or make a
mistake. If we accidentally got Bruce Willis's birth year wrong, we would have
to modify five cells to fix our data, instead of just one.


<!--maybe put something in here about different text versions of the same
information, ex. yes, Yes, Y, and YES
-->

Finally, most spreadsheet applications store their data locally, so unless you
are militant about version control outside of the application, it is easy to
end up with people working on multiple versions of the data. Google Sheets
offers shared access and some version control, but still fails to deliver on
storage capacity, and data integrity.

## Relational Database Management System

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs), or relational databases, are
one type of database. When people use the word "database", nine times out of
ten they are referring to a relational database. Like spreadsheets, RDBMSs
impose a tabular structure on the data they contain. Unlike spreadsheets the
structure of that data can be fairly complex. Relational databases are made up
of tables that are connected through shared columns, called indexes or keys.

Users interact with an RDBMS through the Standardized Query Language (SQL)
instead of a graphical user interface. SQL is a programming language, but it is
one specifically designed for interacting with relational databases. SQL allows
you to standardize your interactions with a database. It allows you to keep a
log of the transactions, and makes it easy to ensure everyone is working with
the same set of data. However, it has a higher barrier to entry than a
graphical user interface like Excel.

To learn more about using SQL in practice, check out the Intro to SQL
([reader](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_intro_to_sql/), workshop)
and Spatial SQL ([reader](https://github.com/ucdavisdatalab/Spatial_SQL),
workshop) resources.

### Relationship keys

A relationship key is a column or pair of columns that links two tables. There
are two types of relationship keys: primary keys and foreign keys. A primary
key is a column that uniquely identifies each row in a particular table. It is
generally the first column in the table and is often named "ID". A foreign key
is a column in one table whose values correspond to a primary key in another
table.

### Entity Relationship Diagrams

Since relational databases are not human readable, it can be helpful to have a
an visual summary of the database without actually needing to look at the data.
That is where Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) come in. ERDs are a
standardized way to depict the structure of a relational database. Each box in
the diagram is a table, with the table title at the top and the column names
listed below it. The column type appears next to each column name. The

Primary/foreign key pairs aare linked in entity relationship diagrams using
connector lines. These lines specify which tables can be joined, and which keys
should be used to join them. They also can specify what type of relationship
the two tables have.

The most common type of table relationship in relational databases is the
one-to-many relationship. In this case, one row in table A may be linked to
many rows in table B. This is the case for the relationship between the people
and crew tables in the IMDB. One-to-one relationships are also fairly common in
relational databases. Two tables are one-to-one when one observation in table A
only corresponds to one observation in table B. This is the relationship
between titles and ratings tables in the IMDB database.

As you might guess, there is a third type of relationship: many-to-many.
Many-to-many relationships are the sleeping giant of database relationships.
They can be very useful, but if you are not careful, they can multiply the size
of your data several times over.

### Why Use Relational Databases?

There are three primary purposes to using RDBMSs as a data store:

1.  Reduce data duplication

2.  Speed up and standardize accessing and updating the database

3.  Ensure data integrity

In our Die Hard spreadsheet example, we had 260 cells. However, if we used a
relational database to store the data, it only uses 156 cells. That is a 40%
reduction in data size. For a multi-gigabyte data set, 40% makes a huge
difference. Additionally, we were able to select only some of the columns from
each table, meaning we didn't need to work with ALL of the data just because we
wanted to work with some of it. This subsetting is much harder in traditional
spreadsheet software.

The IMDB database the Die Hard data comes from is massive relative to what you
could load in a traditional spreadsheet application. The titles table alone has
10 million observations, and the crew table has over 60 million. Despite this,
extracting the Die Hard movie franchise information using an SQL query took
about half a second.

The SQL query I used to extract the Die Hard datais also reproducible. If I
want to collaborate on my analysis of Die Hard a colleague, I don't have to
send the Die Hard data set over to my collaborator. Instead I can provide them
access to to the IMDB database and my SQL query. If I find problems in the data
at a later time, I don't need to send a whole new data set, and potentially
introduce confusion over what data people should be using. All I need to do is
update the database, and tell my colleague to rerun their SQL query. No
additional computer storage necessary.

With an RDBMS, even though the data you analyze may have duplicates, you don't
need to modify each duplicate value, in the case that one requires a
correction. All changes to the data can be made to the singleton values in
their original tables. For example, if you accidentally left out the second "L"
in Bruce Willis's name when entering the data, you would only need to modify
his name once in the "people" table. Then, any time you extract data from the
people table, that change will be automatically propagated to our new data.
While it may be easy to successfully fix 5 errors, it will be much harder to
fix 50, or 5,000. This is especially true if they are scattered throughout your
data set and not just in a single column.

### RDBMS Software

Because of relational databases' widespread utility, there are many software
options to choose from when creating a database. While all of them work off the
same basic SQL, each one puts its own particular spin on the language in terms
of additional functionality. All of the SQL database software options in the
table below have wide community and/or professional support. There are many
more RDBMS applications available for more specific use cases (ex. for use with
Amazon AWS), but these are the most common and widely supported. All of them
provide some level of support for spatial data. However, that level of support
varies, so if you have specific requirements, it's best to do additional
research before making a decision.

## NoSQL Databases

Not Only SQL, or NoSQL, databases are another type of database. They are
primarily defined by what they do not do, namely store data in relational
tables, as a RDBMSs would. Instead, NoSQL databases do not necessarily impose
external structure on the data they contain. In fact, NoSQL databases can
contain data from multiple structures, including

-   documents
-   key-value pairs
-   graphs
-   trees
-   wide column tables

Because of this, NoSQL databases are much better at storing tree and graph
data, as those data structures do not fit well into relational tables.

### Why Use NoSQL Databases?

1.  Compatible with multiple data non-tabular structures

2.  Capable of storing vast amounts of data with impressive speed

3.  Adding more computing power is easier

Because NoSQL databases do not have to adhere to the more rigid structure of
relational databases, they can store more data and access and modify it more
quickly than relational databases. This is particularly important when working
with textual data, which can easily take up many terabytes of storage. It is
also generally easier to upgrade NoSQL databases, which is important when you
are working on the edge of what is possible data storage-wise.

### Example Software

Not every NoSQL database supports every data structure. Some support multiple
structures while others specialize in one. Unlike RDBMSs, all of the most
common NoSQL software is open source, though the MongoDB license is slightly
more restrictive than most open source licenses. Because of this they are also
low cost to implement, though you can always pay for additional features and
support. Similar to RDBMSs, all the most common NoSQL database software
provides some support of spatial data. However, that support is limited to
vector data and the functionality available varies fairly widely.
