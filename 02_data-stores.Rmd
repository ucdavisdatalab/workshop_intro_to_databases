# Data Stores

A data store is a repository for storing and managing data, generally speaking
digitally. Though you could argue that a filing cabinet is an analog data store.
Data stores have two primary functions. First, they need to facilitate people
accessing data from the data store (reading) and making changes to the data in
the data store (writing). Second, they need to maintain the integrity of the
data over time.

It is important to note, not all data stores are databases. A pile of papers on
a desk is definitely not a database, but it could be considered a data store,
albeit a bad one.

## Principles of Data Storage

When you are trying to decide what type of data storage to use, consider these
ideas:

  1. All data has an inherent structure.

  2. Different data structures facilitate different research questions.

  3. All data stores impose an underlying data structure.

  4. The best data storage technology for any research question matches the 
     structure of the data with the structure of the data store.
