A data store is a repository for storing and managing data, generally speaking
digitally. Though you could argue that a things like a filing cabinet or a
library qualify as analog data stores. Data stores have two primary functions.
First, they need to facilitate people accessing data from the data store
(reading) and making changes to the data in the data store (writing). Second,
they need to facilitate this access over a period of time.

It is important to note, not all data stores are databases. A pile of papers on
a desk is definitely not a database, but it could be considered a data store,
albeit a bad one.

## Principles of Data Storage

When you are trying to decide what type of data storage to use, consider these
ideas:

  1. All data has an inherent structure.

  2. Different data structures facilitate different research questions.

  3. All data stores impose an underlying data structure.

  4. The best data storage technology for any research question matches the 
     structure of the data with the structure of the data store.


## Data Store Vocabulary

There are a few concepts that will be useful when describing types of data 
stores and comparing their functionality. 

### Normalization

Data normalization is the process of organizing data in a database in a way
that reduces the database's size. It the organization structure also protects
against typos and other data quality issues from sneaking in. In general, data
normalization will break one group of data into multiple groups.

### Join

While it is much easier to store normalized data, most data analysis will
require you to work with data in a non-normalized form. A data join reverses the
normalization process. It takes multiple groups of data and combines them into
one.

### Scaling

As you add data to a data store, you may need to add computing resources to
the data store to maintain your data store's performance. 

#### Horizontal Scaling

Horizontal scaling is like urban sprawl. It involves adding more individual computers,
servers, or nodes to the database. Because you don't have to muck around with 
upgrading already existing computers, it is easier to implement. Additionally,
there is no theoretical limit on the number of servers you could add to your
database. However, having multiple servers running the same database does 
increase complexity and ongoing support costs.

#### Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling is like building a high rise apartment. It involves adding
computing resources (memory, storage) to a single computer or server. It tends
to be more difficult and expensive than horizontal scaling at the outset, but 
system complexity and ongoing costs stay relatively constant. Additionally,
there is a limit to how much you can upgrade a single machine, so at a certain
point you may need to replace the hardware all together.


## Types of Data Stores

### Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are one of the most, if not the most, ubiquitous form of (digital)
data store. If you have used Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you have used a a
spreadsheet. In fact spreadsheet applications transformed the use of the
personal computer, particularly in business circles. Despite this, a spreadsheet
is not a database. Like most modern applications, spreadsheet software have
graphical user interfaces, making the barrier to entry very low. Spreadsheet
applications also offer some built in analysis tools, so you don't have to learn
a new application to do basic statistics and data visualization.

However, spreadsheets suffer from some severe limitations. They offer limited
storage capacity, don't have normalization capabilities, so your 
data takes up even more space than it would otherwise. The lack of normalization
means it is easy to compromise data integrity and end up with ____ (ex. yes,
Yes, and YES coded as different responses). There is also no way to 
independently scale up computing resources for a spreadsheet application. 

Finally, most spreadsheet applications store their data locally, so unless you
are militant about version control outside of the application, it is easy to end
up with people working on multiple versions of the data. Google Sheets offers
shared access and some version control, but still fails to deliver on storage
capacity, resource scaling, and data integrity.

### Relational Database Management System

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) are one type of database. 

#### ERDs

#### Relationship keys

### NoSQL
