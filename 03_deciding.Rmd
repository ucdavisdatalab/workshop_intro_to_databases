# Choosing the Right Data Store

You've just learned a bunch of information about data structures and data
stores. Now the challenge is applying that information to your own data. When
you are trying to decide what type of data storage to use, consider these ideas:

1.  Different data structures facilitate different research questions.

1.  When we convert information to data, we encode it in a structure.

3.  All data stores impose structure on your data.

4.  The best data storage technology for any research question matches the
    structure of the data with the structure of the data store.
    
All information needs to be encoded in a data structure in order for it to be
useful in research. When you have identified your research question, you can use
that to determine what data structures will make it easiest for you to carry
out your research. Finally you can match the structure, size, and use case
of your data to the data store(s) that best fit your needs.

It is important to remember that as you ask different questions of your data,
you may need to change how you structure and store that data. Reproducibility
experts will sometimes require that you only store one "definitive" version of
your data. However, that plan rarely survives first contact with a research
project. If you want understand a subject deeply, you need to ask many different
types of questions about it. And this necessitates storing your data in multiple
forms.

Some important questions to consider when you are deciding on a data store are:

 * What is the structure of the data to be stored?
 * How much data needs to be stored?
 * How many people will be accessing the data store?
 * How frequently will people be interacting with the data?
 * Will the data be updated by humans or by a computer?
 * How will people be accessing the data?

<!-- Have a research project or question what is a good structure and 
and database option, what would be a good second option, what would not work -->
