We will discuss how data structure and data types impact your storage options, when you should use a database, and which platforms you might consider for your research. This workshop is a general lecture with case studies and Q&amp;A (no laptops necessary). This workshop is a prerequisite for DataLabâ€™s Intro to SQL for Querying Databases workshop and part of the Research Computing micro-credential Learning Goals By the end of this workshop, learners should be able to: Describe different data set structures Compare and contrast different data storage platforms Explain the differences between SQL and noSQL databases Explain the components of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Define relational keys Identify appropriate data storage solutions based on the structure of a research data set "],["data.html", "1 Data 1.1 Data Types 1.2 Data Structures 1.3 Picking a Data Structure", " 1 Data Quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, considered collectively. Also (in non-technical contexts): information in digital form. - Oxford English Dictionary Over the centuries, nay millennia, humans have stored information in a startlingly diverse set of mediums, from oral narratives and pictographs, to printed text and now 1s and 0s. While in current times data is generally digital, people collected data long before the existence of the computer. They just had to store it differently. 1.1 Data Types 1.2 Data Structures 1.2.1 Columnar/Tabular 1.2.2 Graph 1.2.3 Tree 1.2.4 Relational/Categorical 1.3 Picking a Data Structure "],["data-stores.html", "2 Data Stores 2.1 Principles of Data Storage 2.2 Data Store Vocabulary 2.3 Types of Data Stores", " 2 Data Stores A repository for persistently storing and managing collections of data which include not just repositories like databases, but also simpler store types such as simple files, emails etc. Wikipedia A data store is a repository for storing and managing data, generally speaking digitally. Though you could argue that a things like a filing cabinet or a library qualify as analog data stores. Data stores have two primary functions. First, they need to facilitate people accessing data from the data store (reading) and making changes to the data in the data store (writing). Second, they need to maintain the integrity of the data over time. It is important to note, not all data stores are databases. A pile of papers on a desk is definitely not a database, but it could be considered a data store, albeit a bad one. 2.1 Principles of Data Storage When you are trying to decide what type of data storage to use, consider these ideas: All data has an inherent structure. Different data structures facilitate different research questions. All data stores impose an underlying data structure. The best data storage technology for any research question matches the structure of the data with the structure of the data store. 2.2 Data Store Vocabulary 2.2.1 Normalization 2.2.2 Join 2.2.3 Vertical Scaling 2.2.4 Horizontal Scaling 2.3 Types of Data Stores 2.3.1 Spreadsheets 2.3.2 Relational Database Management System 2.3.2.1 ERDs 2.3.2.2 Relationship keys 2.3.3 NoSQL "],["assessment.html", "3 Assessment", " 3 Assessment "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
