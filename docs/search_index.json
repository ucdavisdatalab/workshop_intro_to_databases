We will discuss how data structure and data types impact your storage options, when you should use a database, and which platforms you might consider for your research. This workshop is a general lecture with case studies and Q&amp;A (no laptops necessary). This workshop is a prerequisite for DataLab’s Intro to SQL for Querying Databases workshop and part of the Research Computing micro-credential Learning Goals By the end of this workshop, learners should be able to: Describe different data set structures Compare and contrast different data storage platforms Explain the differences between SQL and noSQL databases Explain the components of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Define relational keys Identify appropriate data storage solutions based on the structure of a research data set "],["data.html", "1 Data 1.1 Data Types 1.2 Data Structures 1.3 Tree 1.4 Categorical - Relational 1.5 Picking a Data Structure", " 1 Data Quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, considered collectively. Also (in non-technical contexts): information in digital form. - Oxford English Dictionary Over the centuries, nay millennia, humans have stored information in a startlingly diverse set of mediums, from oral narratives and pictographs, to printed text and now 1s and 0s. While in current times data is generally digital, people collected data long before the existence of the computer. They just had to store it differently. In general, data (singular datum) is information about the real world that has been translated into a form that can be easily shared and stored for later use. 1.1 Data Types A datum’s type tells the computer what types of operations a user will do with the given data. Common data types include integers, decimal or floating point numbers, characters (text), Boolean values (TRUE and FALSE) and date/times. Data type also influences how data is stored. Unlike other characteristics we will discuss later, an individual datum can have a type. Data type is not necessarily inherent to a piece of information, though it is often strongly suggested. For example, you can store the value of 1 as the integer 1, the decimal 1.0, the text “1”, the Boolean TRUE, or the date 1900-01-01 00:00:00. The underlying information is the same (1), but the computer will treat each of these pieces of data differently. It will not allow you to add “1” to another number, and it may have issues combining the integer or decimal 1.0 with text. Text itself can only be stored as characters, and decimal numbers can only be stored as floats and characters. 1.2 Data Structures A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. Wikipedia Unlike with data types, a single datum cannot have a data structure. This is because data structure is about capturing relationships between data points, there isn’t any meaningful information to be gained from the relationship of a data point with itself. There are four basic data structures: tabular/columnar, graph, tree, and categorical/relational data. In practice, data often traits from multiple data structures. 1.2.1 Columnar/Tabular Tabular or columnar data is made up of rows and columns, collectively referred to as a table. Each row represents an observation, and each column a measurement from that observation. There are no explicit relationships between observations. 1.2.2 Graph Graph data structure explicitly captures between entities. In graphs, relationships are defined by position and distance. relationships are directional 1.3 Tree Tree data is very similar to graph data in many ways trees also explicitly capture relationships between entities. However, in trees the relationships are hierarchical. The number of nodes separating an entity from a common root defines that entity’s place in the hierarchy. 1.4 Categorical - Relational In categorical data, category membership is the organizing principle of the data structure. Entities can have membership in multiple categories, and relationships are defined between categories instead of the entities themselves. As such, relationships tend to represent complex processes rather than individual entities. 1.5 Picking a Data Structure As mentioned previously, data represents information from the real world. And all information in the real world can be thought of in a larger context, like zooming out with a camera lens. You can use this context to identify the best structure to use for your data. If you view your data as observation of some larger phenomenon, tabular data could be a good fit. If you are more concerned about how various entities relate to each other in the context of your research, a graph may be more appropriate. Additionally, many research questions are complex enough that one data structure on its own may not be sufficient to capture all the information necessary to answer the question. It it is very common to combine data structures to capture more information that one could on its own. Most observation based data sets are actually a combination of tabular data and categorical - relational data, which captures information about the relationships between observations. Phylogenetic trees, the data structure most commonly used in the study of evolution, is a combination of the graph and tree data structures.

Though you could argue that a things like a filing cabinet or a library qualify as analog data stores. Data stores have two primary functions. First, they need to facilitate people accessing data from the data store (reading) and making changes to the data in the data store (writing). Second, they need to facilitate this access over a period of time. It is important to note, not all data stores are databases. A pile of papers on a desk is definitely not a database, but it could be considered a data store, albeit a bad one. 2.1 Principles of Data Storage When you are trying to decide what type of data storage to use, consider these ideas: All data has an inherent structure. Different data structures facilitate different research questions. All data stores impose an underlying data structure. The best data storage technology for any research question matches the structure of the data with the structure of the data store. 2.2 Data Store Vocabulary There are a few concepts that will be useful when describing types of data stores and comparing their functionality. 2.2.1 Normalization Data normalization is the process of organizing data in a database in a way that reduces the database’s size. It the organization structure also protects against typos and other data quality issues from sneaking in. In general, data normalization will break one group of data into multiple groups. 2.2.2 Join While it is much easier to store normalized data, most data analysis will require you to work with data in a non-normalized form. A data join reverses the normalization process. It takes multiple groups of data and combines them into one. 2.2.3 Scaling As you add data to a data store, you may need to add computing resources to the data store to maintain your data store’s performance. 2.2.3.1 Horizontal Scaling Horizontal scaling is like urban sprawl. It involves adding more individual computers, servers, or nodes to the database. Because you don’t have to muck around with upgrading already existing computers, it is easier to implement. Additionally, there is no theoretical limit on the number of servers you could add to your database. However, having multiple servers running the same database does increase complexity and ongoing support costs. 2.2.3.2 Vertical Scaling Vertical scaling is like building a high rise apartment. It involves adding computing resources (memory, storage) to a single computer or server. It tends to be more difficult and expensive than horizontal scaling at the outset, but system complexity and ongoing costs stay relatively constant. Additionally, there is a limit to how much you can upgrade a single machine, so at a certain point you may need to replace the hardware all together. 2.3 Types of Data Stores 2.3.1 Spreadsheets Spreadsheets are one of the most, if not the most, ubiquitous form of (digital) data store. If you have used Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, you have used a a spreadsheet. In fact spreadsheet applications transformed the use of the personal computer, particularly in business circles. Despite this, a spreadsheet is not a database. Like most modern applications, spreadsheet software have graphical user interfaces, making the barrier to entry very low. Spreadsheet applications also offer some built in analysis tools, so you don’t have to learn a new application to do basic statistics and data visualization. However, spreadsheets suffer from some severe limitations. They offer limited storage capacity, don’t have normalization capabilities, so your data takes up even more space than it would otherwise. The lack of normalization means it is easy to compromise data integrity and end up with ____ (ex. yes, Yes, and YES coded as different responses). There is also no way to independently scale up computing resources for a spreadsheet application. Finally, most spreadsheet applications store their data locally, so unless you are militant about version control outside of the application, it is easy to end up with people working on multiple versions of the data. Google Sheets offers shared access and some version control, but still fails to deliver on storage capacity, resource scaling, and data integrity. 2.3.1.1 Examples Microsoft Excel Google Sheets Numbers LibreOffice Calc OpenRefine Open Science Framework 2.3.2 Relational Database Management System Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) are one type of database. 2.3.2.1 ERDs 2.3.2.2 Relationship keys 2.3.3 NoSQL "],["choosing-the-right-data-store.html", "3 Choosing the Right Data Store 3.1 CAP Theorem 3.2 Polyglot Persistance", " 3 Choosing the Right Data Store 3.1 CAP Theorem 3.2 Polyglot Persistance "],["assessment.html", "4 Assessment", " 4 Assessment "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
