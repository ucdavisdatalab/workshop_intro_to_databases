Now the challenge is applying that information to your own data. When you are trying to decide what type of data storage to use, consider these ideas: Different data structures facilitate different research questions. When we convert information to data, we encode it in a structure. All data stores impose structure on your data. The best data storage technology for any research question matches the structure of the data with the structure of the data store. All information needs to be encoded in a data structure in order for it to be useful in research. When you have identified your research question, you can use that to determine what data structures will make it easiest for you to carry out your research. Finally you can match the structure, size, and use case of your data to the data store(s) that best fit your needs. It is important to remember that as you ask different questions of your data, you may need to change how you structure and store that data. Reproducibility experts will sometimes require that you only store one “definitive” version of your data. However, that plan rarely survives first contact with a research project. If you want understand a subject deeply, you need to ask many different types of questions about it. And this necessitates storing your data in multiple forms. Some important questions to consider when you are deciding on a data store are: What is the structure of the data to be stored? How much data needs to be stored? How many people will be accessing the data store? How frequently will people be interacting with the data? Will the data be updated by humans or by a computer? How will people be accessing the data? 4.1 Further Reading 4.1.1 General Database Information Intro to Databases (for people who don’t know a whole lot about them) Database Management System (DBMS) Tutorial NoSQL Explained Introduction to NoSQL 4.1.2 Learning Query Languages W3Schools SQL Tutorial W3Schools PostgreSQL Tutorial W3Schools MongoDB Tutorial 4.1.3 Campus Database Resources Research Data Services, and the data service librarians Research Data Management Topic Guide UC Davis Cloud Services, includes Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and private cloud services Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
