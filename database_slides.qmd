Before we dive in...some info. Not required but helpful for me
to know. Raise your hand if:

-   Have data you are working with or are in the process of collecting data
-   Analyze data using a programming language like R or Python
-   Know what a database is
-   Have used a database before

next step.

Data store -> method of storing your data.

databases are a type data store but not the only type

-   **Structure:**
    -   Determined by research question
    -   stores impose structure so match structure to store
-   **Interaction:**
    -   how you format/reformat your data
    -   based on what analysis you do
    -   one way or many ways
-   **Management:** 
    -   logistics around your data
    -   who collects it, and how frequently
    -   how many people access it? 
    -   how long does it need to be available
-   **Computing Resources:** 
    -   size of your data
    -   software you have access to, features you need

**Data is information translated into a form for storage and later use. **

</center>

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

That form could be:

-   Rows and columns of a spreadsheet
-   A visual diagram
-   Written human language
-   And many others...

-   paper is still data, and can be a problem
-   Clay cuniform tablet, Neo-Sumerian 2041 BCE, cattle receipt
-   form is the data's structure
-   what form our data takes can help guide our choice of data store
-   spreadsheets are very familiar
-   people now think of language as data

    
So how to we categorize our data?
:::


## Data Types{background-image="img/slides/Noun_Data.png"
              background-size="8%" background-position="97% 97%"}

Data type tells your computer what types of operations make sense.

-   integer
-   decimal/floating point numbers
-   categorical (small, medium, large)
-   characters (text)
-   Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE)
-   dates and times
-   spatial data

:::{.notes}

-   Side effects of working on a computer
-   May be different than computer science and informatics data types
-   tells the computer what to do with a piece of information
-   Single point can have data type
-   1 as int, decimal, text and date

-   Now we will dig deeper on data stores themselves.
-   Note: I make a lot of generalizations about how different software works
-   You could fine counter examples to each
-   ex. google sheets and concurrent editing without conflicts
-   What I'm just saying is rule of thumb 
-   Ask if you have questions

**Data store:** where your data is saved + how you interact with your data

<br>

**GUI:** Graphical User Interface, a software application that allows you to 
interact with the computer via icons, buttons, and windows.

:::

:::{.notes}
-   Data store storage+interaction
-   these can be independent or together in one software package
-   can be very simple or complex
-   They also may impose a structure
-   Gui - graphical user interface
-   as opposed to command line interface

**Query:** database commands that create, read, update, delete (CRUD) 

<br>

**Transaction:** the unit of work in a database, succeeds or fails as a 
unit. Allows database to prevent conflicts.

:::

:::{.notes}

-   Query - how you interact with a database, submit through the command line
interface
-   Transaction - database unit of work
    -   tracking transactions allows database to prevent conflicts
    -   transaction succeeds or fails as a unit
    -   if an update affects multiple parts of a database, the update only 
    succeeds if every individual part of it is allowed.

1.  **Structure:** tabular

2.  **Interaction:** Graphical User Interface (GUI), reformatting is hard

3.  **Management:**
    
    - Managing multiple users is challenging
    - Easy to introduce typos or erros when adding data

4.  **Computing Resources:**

    - Software is easy to use and widely available
    - GUI limits data size
    - Lots of data duplication

-   Stand alone (not generally linked to other files)
-   Supports relatively low complexity in data
-   Interact via GUI or programming language
-   One person can edit at a time
-   Data storage determined by GUI, is generally low 
-   Software is very widely available and UC Davis provides licenses
-   Very easy to use

:::

<!--
-   Imposes tabular data structure
-   Widely available and easy to use via a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
-   Generally limited to 1 million rows or 10 million cells if using a GUI
-   Setting permissions is cumbersome
-   Easy to introduce typos or errors
-   May cause a lot of data duplication

-   lots of duplication (260)
-   if there is a typo it may be hard to find
-   may need to correct typos multiple times, in various places
-   then redistribute the data

-   Both the data storage mechanism and interaction engine 
-   Related to relational data but this is a data store not structure

1. **Structure:** Tables connected by shared columns called keys

2. **Interaction:** 

    - SQL (Structured Query Language)
    - Data manipulation is easy and reproducible

3. **Management**

    - Built in data quality control and multi-user management
    - Standardizes data updates
    - Provides definitive version of your data

4. **Computing Resources**

    - Few built-in size restrictions
    - Requires some specialized setup
    - thousands of transactions per day

:::

:::{.notes}
-   tabular and relational
-   instead of GUI, use SQL on command line, much easier than PL
  -   interacting is reproducible
  -   standardizes process for updating data
-   automatically deals with conflicts via transactions
  - multiple people can edit at a time
-   built in version control and admin
  - easy to set permissions
-   larger storage capacity, reduced data duplication
-   free options and options through UC Davis Licensing

Pair of columns with the same values

:::{.notes}
-   databases store connected data
-   tables connected by shared columns = keys
-   keys implement relational part of relational database
-   Primary key = column in table where key uniquely identifies observations
-   Foreign key = primary key in another table, isn't necessarily unique
-   Allows us to look up phone number without storing phone number with sales

-  Reduce data duplication

-  Speed up and standardize accessing and updating the data

-  Ease of reformatting data

-  Ensure data integrity

-  Manage multiple users

:::

:::{.notes}
-   duplication = 260 -> 156 is 40% reduction in size
-   SQL makes everything standardized and reproducible
-   update database once and everyone runs new query and gets new data
-   very fast = 60M observations, query took 0.5 seconds
-   relational nature makes it easy to recombine and reformat data
-   data type rules mean QC is easier
-   only change typos once in source table
-   set permissions and transactions take care of conflicts
