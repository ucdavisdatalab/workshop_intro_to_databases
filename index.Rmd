# Overview {.unnumbered}

This workshop provides a broad overview of the various technologies for storing
and organizing different collections of data. We will discuss how data structure
and data types impact your storage options, when you should use a database, and
which platforms you might consider for your research. This workshop is a general
lecture with case studies and Q&A (no laptops necessary). This workshop is a
prerequisite for DataLab's [Intro to SQL for Querying Databases][sql] workshop
and part of the [Research Computing micro-credential][micro_cred]

## You might need a database if... {-}

  * Your data set has many repeated values in its columns
  
  * Your data set contains information about many unrelated or loosely related
  studies
  
  * You are sharing data with multiple people and everyone seems to have a
  different version
  
  * Your data set is so large, your computer freezes when trying to view it
  
  * You have to keep making the same corrections to your data over and over
  again
  
  * Excel keeps converting your columns to the wrong data type
  
  * You have so many pivot tables
  
  * You have hundreds (or thousands) of data files you need to share with your
  collaborators
  
  * You think PowerQuery is neat but wish people would stop changing the
  underlying data while you are using it.

## Learning Goals {-}

By the end of this workshop, learners should be able to:

-   Describe different data set structures

-   Compare and contrast different data storage platforms

-   Explain the differences between SQL and noSQL databases

-   Explain the components of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

-   Define relational keys

-   Identify appropriate data storage solutions based on the structure
    of a research data set
