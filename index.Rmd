# Overview {.unnumbered}

This workshop provides a broad overview of the various technologies for storing
and organizing different collections of data. We will discuss how data structure
and data types impact your storage options, when you should use a database, and
which platforms you might consider for your research. This workshop is a general
lecture with case studies and Q&A (no laptops necessary). This workshop is a
prerequisite for DataLab's [Intro to SQL for Querying Databases][sql] 
and [Spatial SQL with SpatiaLite][spat_sql] workshops as well as being part of 
the [Research Computing micro-credential][micro_cred]

## Learning Goals {.unnumbered}

After completing this workshop, you will be able to answer the following
questions:

  * What is the difference between information and data?
  
  * What are the most common data structures people use?
  
  * Which data structures lend themselves to answering different types of
  research questions?
  
  * What is a database?
  
  * What are the differences between relational and noSQL databases?
  
  * When would a database help answer a research question?
