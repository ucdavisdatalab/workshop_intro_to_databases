Over the centuries, nay millennia, humans have stored information in a 
startlingly diverse set of mediums, from oral narratives and pictographs, to 
printed text and now 1s and 0s. While in current times data is generally 
digital, people collected data long before the existence of the computer. They
just had to store it differently. In general, data (singular datum) is
information that has been translated into a form that can be easily shared
and stored for later use.

## Data Types

A datum's type tells the computer what types of operations a user will do with
the given data. Common data types include integers, decimal or floating point
numbers, characters (text), Boolean values (TRUE and FALSE) and date/times. Data
type also influences how data is stored. Unlike other characteristics we will
discuss later, an individual datum can have a type.

Data type is not necessarily inherent to a piece of information, though it is
often strongly suggested. For example, you can store the value of 1 as the
integer 1, the decimal 1.0, the text "1", the Boolean TRUE, or the date
1900-01-01 00:00:00. The underlying information is the same (1), but the
computer will treat each of these pieces of data differently. It will not allow
you to add "1" to another number, and it may have issues combining the integer
or decimal 1.0 with text. Text itself can only be stored as characters, and
decimal numbers can only be stored as floats and characters.
