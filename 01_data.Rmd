Over the centuries, nay millennia, humans have stored information in a 
startlingly diverse set of mediums, from oral narratives and pictographs, to 
printed text and now 1s and 0s. While in current times data is generally 
digital, people collected data long before the existence of the computer. They
just had to store it differently.
