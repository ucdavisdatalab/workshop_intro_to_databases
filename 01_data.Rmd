Over the centuries, nay millennia, humans have stored information in a 
startlingly diverse set of mediums, from oral narratives and pictographs, to 
printed text and now 1s and 0s. While in current times data is generally 
digital, people collected data long before the existence of the computer. They
just had to store it differently. In general, data (singular datum) is
information about the real world that has been translated into a form that can
be easily shared and stored for later use.

## Data Types

A datum's type tells the computer what types of operations a user will do with
the given data. Common data types include integers, decimal or floating point
numbers, characters (text), Boolean values (TRUE and FALSE) and date/times. Data
type also influences how data is stored. Unlike other characteristics we will
discuss later, an individual datum can have a type.

Data type is not necessarily inherent to a piece of information, though it is
often strongly suggested. For example, you can store the value of 1 as the
integer 1, the decimal 1.0, the text "1", the Boolean TRUE, or the date
1900-01-01 00:00:00. The underlying information is the same (1), but the
computer will treat each of these pieces of data differently. It will not allow
you to add "1" to another number, and it may have issues combining the integer
or decimal 1.0 with text. Text itself can only be stored as characters, and
decimal numbers can only be stored as floats and characters.

## Data Structures

As mentioned previously, data represents information from the real world.

You can use this context to identify the best structure to use for your data. 

Unlike with data types, a single datum cannot have a data structure. This is
because data structure is about capturing relationships between data points,
there isn't any meaningful information to be gained from the relationship of a
data point with itself.

There are four basic data structures: tabular/columnar, graph, tree, and
categorical/relational data. In practice, data often traits from multiple data
structures.

### Columnar/Tabular

Tabular or columnar data is made up of rows and columns, collectively referred
to as a table. Each row represents an observation, and each column a measurement
from that observation. There are no explicit relationships between observations.

### Graph

Graph data structure explicitly captures between entities. In graphs, 
relationships are defined by position and distance. *relationships are directional*

## Tree 

Tree data is very similar to graph data in many ways trees also explicitly
capture relationships between entities. However, in trees the relationships
are hierarchical. 

## Categorical - Relational 

In categorical data, category membership is the organizing principle of the 
data structure. Entities can have membership in multiple categories, and
relationships are defined between categories instead of the entities themselves.
As such, relationships tend to represent complex processes rather than
individual entities.
