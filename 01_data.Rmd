Information becomes data when it takes on a structure.

some data has a structure that is inherent to the information
Data is actionable, either by humans or by computers by putting it in some sort 
of structure (including natural language: syntax and grammar), text isn't 
unstructured it just hasn't been restructured to make it actionable

two structures; inherent structure and structure we impose on the data
The process of (re)structuring data is at least as important as the analysis 
we do afterward.

Things inform your data structure: inherent structure in data, and the question
you want to ask?

Ex you might throw the structure away ex with a lot of LLMs through the grammatical
structure away.

You will almost always have multiple versions of data in different structures
so you can ask different questions

Note: there are other definitions of data structure from other disciplines
(ex. in comp sci), we will not be using those definitions
-->

If you are doing research, chances are you are going to be working with data in
some form or another. Even if you do not use traditional rows and columns, you
are certainly working with some form of information. And if you have translated
information into a form that is more easily shared or stored for later use, you
are working with data. Information becomes data when we give it some sort of
structure. That could be the rows and columns of a table, or something
more human readable, like the grammar and syntax of natural language in text 
form.

One of the challenges of working with data is figuring out a useful way, to
store it. Thankfully, we have mostly left behind the 20th century's favorite way
of storing data: paper in filing cabinets. Modern digital methods definitely
take up less space but also have a higher barrier to entry. There are many more
types of data stores available now as well. This means you will need to make a
decision on which one to use. **Ultimately, the best way to store your data**
**will depend on the data you want to store and the questions you want to ask**
**with it.**

When describing data, we generally talk about two main characteristics: data 
type and data structure.

## Data Types

Your data's type tells the computer what sorts of operations make sense. Common
data types include:

  * integers
  * decimal
  * floating point numbers
  * characters (text)
  * Boolean values (TRUE and FALSE)
  * Dates and times

All data, including individual data points, have a type. However, a given piece
of information can be stored using multiple data types. For example, you can
store the value of 1 as the integer 1, the decimal 1.0, the text "1", the
Boolean TRUE, or the date 1900-01-02. The underlying information is the same
(1), but the computer will treat each of these pieces of data differently. It
will not allow you to add "1" to another number, and it may have issues
combining the integer or decimal 1.0 with text. Text itself can only be stored
as characters.

## Data Structures

> A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them,
> and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

> Wikipedia

Unlike with data types, a single piece of data cannot have a data structure.
This is because data structure is about capturing relationships between data
points. We will discuss five of the most common data: tabular/columnar, graph,
tree, categorical/relational, and spatial data. In practice, data often exhibits
traits from multiple data structures.

Data is information translated into a form to store for
later use. The type of information you work with does not dictate the type of
data structure you must use. However, some types of information lend themselves
to particular data structures over others.

When trying to decide what data structure to use to represent information from
your research, the key is to focus on what sorts of questions you would like to
ask. Each data structure will make answering some types of questions easier or harder. If you want to ask disparate types of questions, you may need to
represent your data using multiple structures. Because data structure has such a
large impact on how you interact with your data, the structure you choose is
just as important as the analysis you do afterward.


### Columnar/Tabular

<!--
Convention is rows are observations and columns are your variables,
value associated with a given variable for a given observation lives in that
cell

Discrete (brief) observations of a particular thing, 
dealing with a class of object where every observation of one of those objects
can be described using the same set of variables

sorting is easy

better at working across the entire data structure

location and scale aka spread
-->


```{r format_cars, echo=FALSE}

makers = c('Mazda', 'Merc', 'Toyota', 'Ferarri', 'Lincoln', 'Chrysler', 'Dodge')
origins = c(rep('Japan', 2), rep('Europe', 7), rep('Japan', 2), rep('USA', 3))


maker_ids = sapply(makers, grep, rownames(mtcars)) |> 
  unlist(use.names=FALSE) |>
  unique()

mpg = mtcars[maker_ids, c('mpg', 'cyl', 'hp', 'wt', 'am')]

rownames(mpg) = gsub('Merc', 'Mercedes-Benz', rownames(mpg))
mpg$origin = origins

names(mpg) = c('mpg', 'cylinders', 'horsepower', 'weight', 'manual', 'origin')

```


Tabular or columnar data is made up of rows and columns, collectively referred
to as a table.  By convention, each row represents an observation, and each
column a measurement or aspect of that observation. Tabular data is incredibly
common, especially in the sciences. Many researchers, regardless of field store
at least some of their data in tabular form. Tables work well when all of the
objects in your study can be summarized with the same set of characteristics.
Many study designs require this, which is one of the reasons why tabular data
is so common.

The table below contains data from the US magazine *Motor Trend* in 1974. In the
table below, each row is an observation of a car model released between 1973 and
1974. The magazine recorded the make, model and origin of each car and measured
the car's fuel efficiency (mpg), horsepower, weight, and number of cylinders in
the engine.

```{r display_mpg, echo=FALSE}

mpg

```

Other examples of data sets that lend themselves to a tabular data structure
include California almond yields (lb/acre) for farms around the state, climate
data over the past 50 years, snow accumulation (inches) for Lake Tahoe, and
biomarkers for people participating in a study on a chronic illness.

Tabular data lends itself to answering questions about the average value or
spread of a particular measurement over the entire data set. It can also help
investigate trends in a particular variable, or how two variables relate to
each other. In the case of the car fuel efficiency data, we could ask about the
relative fuel efficiency of cars from different parts of the world or if there
is any relationship between a car's weight and its horsepower. The tabular data
structure also makes sorting observations very easy.

### Trees

<!--
tree like structure of inheritance from a root
we could express tree data as a data frame but you end up with a lot of empty or
missing data because not every mother node will have the same number of daughter
nodes 

better working within groups and knowing what groups

set up emails as a tree -> threads = trees

xml is for trees, nested data = tree data
-->

Trees are another commonly used data structure. Tree structured data explicitly
capture hierarchical relationships between entities. Trees are made of up nodes
(or vertices) which represent entities in the data, and edges which represent
relationships between those entities. The number of edges separating an entity
from a common root node defines that entity's place in the hierarchy. When
viewing tree structured data on a computer, it often looks very "nested", like
sections and subsections of a document. In fact, tree data is sometimes
referred to as document structured data because of this.

In general, tree data facilitates asking questions about particular subsets of 
the data. For example, you might want to know how closely two entities are
related, which branches of the tree have the most nodes, or all of the
observations that fall under a particular subtree.

Family trees are a common example of tree structured data. In family
trees, the nodes represent people in the family. Horizontal lines represent
marriages or couplings, and vertical lines represent a connection to
offspring. In the family tree of the Tutor Dynasty in England below, it is easy
to determine things like who had the most wives (Henry VIII), which people
shared a generation, and who was the last member of the dynasty (James I of
England). Questions like what was the average age at death for the Tudors
would be harder to answer.

We can also represent the car fuel efficiency data with a tree data structure.
This makes it much harder to answer some of the questions mentioned in the
previous section. On the other hand, the tree structure makes it very easy to
see which car manufacturer produced the greatest number of models in 1973-74 and 
how many different models came out of Japan during that time period.

### Graphs

<!--
graphs are rysomatic

they have no root, they only have a node that you care about this at the moment

-->

Graph data is similar to tree data in many ways. It also explicitly captures
information about relationships between entities using nodes and edges. However,
unlike trees, graph data sets have no inherent center or root node, and there is
no implicit hierarchy or nesting. Additionally, the relationships between the
vertices can be directional, and that direction does not have to be consistent
throughout the graph.

![](img/graph_data.png){width=75%}

Graph structured data tends to be more common in the social sciences and
humanities. One of the most ubiquitous examples of a graph is the social
network. Transportation data, like roads and flight paths, also lend themselves
to the graph structure. In the digital world, we can use graphs to map out the
link connections between Wikipedia pages, as seen below with Abraham Lincoln.

![](img/abraham_lincoln.png)

Graphs make it easy to ask questions about connectivity. For example we might
want to know how many flight connections we will need to make between Honolulu, 
Hawaii and Cairo, Egypt, or how many degrees of separation there are between 
Abraham Lincoln and Kevin Bacon on Wikipedia. We can also ask about which parts of 
the graph are the most connected and which are the least connected.

### Categorical - Relational 

<!--
Do I need this?
-->

In categorical data, category membership is the organizing principle of the 
data structure. Entities can have membership in multiple categories, and
relationships are defined between categories instead of the entities themselves.
As such, relationships tend to represent complex processes rather than
individual entities.

One example of this type of data is student club membership at UC Davis. 

### Spatial
Depending on the context, spatial data can be thought of as either a data type,
or a data structure. This workshop focuses on how data structures enable us
to ask different types of questions. Since spatial data allows us to ask novel
questions, we will discuss spatial data as a data structure.

In spatial data, the organizing principle is location. This can be geographic
location (ex latitude/longitude) or relative location on an arbitrary grid (ex.
[2, 4]). Data can either be continuous, like a sheet over a landscape, or
discrete like points on a map. In fact, map making is one of the most
common uses of spatial data. However, we can also ask as questions like whether
points are clustered more closely than we would expect, and whether we can use
nearby data to predict values for places where we don't any.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(sf))

#read in North Carolina data
nc = st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf"), quiet = TRUE)

plot_title = 'Live Births in North Carolina from 1974-1978'

plot(nc['BIR74'], key.pos=1, main=plot_title)
```
