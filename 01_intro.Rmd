When deciding on a method for storing your data (a data store), there are four
primary aspects to consider: your data's structure, the ways to anticipate 
interacting with your data, your data management needs, and the computing
resources you have access to. 

1.  **Data Structure:** What are my research questions?

2.  **Data Interaction**
       
    - What kinds of analysis will I do?
    - How does my data need to be formatted?

3.  **Data Management**
    
    - When and how is the data collected?
    - Who needs access to it? one or more people?
    - How long does the data need to persist?

4.  **Computing Resources**

    - How much data do I have?
    - Do I have access to external or shared storage space?
    - What software to I have licenses for?
